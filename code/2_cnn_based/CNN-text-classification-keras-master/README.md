# CNN-text-classification-keras

It is simplified implementation of [Implementing a CNN for Text Classification in TensorFlow](http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/) in Keras as functional api

# Requirements
- [Python 3.5.2](https://www.python.org/)
- [Keras 2.1.2](http://keras.io/)
- [Tensorflow 1.4.1](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

# Traning
Run the below command and it will run for 100 epochs if you want change it just open [model.py](https://github.com/bhaveshoswal/CNN-text-classification-keras/blob/master/model.py)

`python model.py`

# For new data
You have to rebuild the vocabulary and then train.
