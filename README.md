# FakeNewsDetection
Repository for fake news detection using deep learning

The jupyter notebooks in the path FakeNewsDetection/code/2_cnn_based/ namely CNN_based_models.ipynb and LSTM_based_approach.ipynb contains code for detecting fake news using 1D-CNN based and LSTM based binary classification based approach respectively. The dataset used is the same dataset used in the paper TI-CNN: Convolutional Neural Networks for Fake News Detection (https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00749).
